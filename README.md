# multifactorEquityPortfolio

This project is the direct application of Russel and Nasdaq Papers on equity protfolio optimisation based on factor signals. 
Investments can only be made between 5 main factors: Value, Growth, Quality, Momentum and Size. 
Those 5 factors mades of the price of shares of companies were built looking at the Value, Growth, Quality, Momentum and Size of those major companies. 
The idea of this project was to compare the impact of different portfolio optimisation methods on the return but also the volatility of the portfolios.
